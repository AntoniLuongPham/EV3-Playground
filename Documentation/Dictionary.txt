ev3.motorOff
Definition
The `motorOff` function turns the motor off. It is usually used to stop a motor that was started by the 'motorOn' function earlier in the program. If withBrake is "True", the motor is stopped immediately. The motor will be held in its stopped position until another function starts it, or until the program ends. If withBrake is "False", power to the motor is simply turned off. The motor will coast using any remaining momentum until it stops, or until another function starts.

ev3.motorOn
Definition
The `motorOn` function controls a motor. You can turn a motor on or off, control its power level, or turn the motor on for a specified length of time or number of rotations. The 'motorOn' function turns the motor on, then immediately continues to the next block in the program unless the duration is specified by using the forSeconds, forDegrees or forRotations parameters. You can control the speed and direction of the motor using the withPower parameters. The motor will run until it is stopped or changed by another instruction later in the program, or until the program ends.

ev3.move
Definition
The `move` function can make a robot drive forward, backward, turn, or stop. Use the 'move' function for robot vehicles that have two Large Motors, with one motor driving the left side of the vehicle and the other driving the right side. You can make the two motors move at different speeds or in different directions to make your robot turn. The 'move' function turns both motors on, then immediately continues to the next instruction in the program unless the duration is specified by using the forSeconds, forDegrees or forRotations parameters. You can control the speed and direction of the motors using the leftPower and rightPower parameters. The motors will run until they are stopped or changed by another instruction later in the program, or until the program ends.

ev3.playSound
Definition
The `playSound` function plays sound using the speaker inside the EV3 Brick. You can play pre-recorded sound files or specify a musical note or tone.

ev3.resetGyro
Definition
The `resetGyro` function allows you to reset the gyro counter.

ev3.resetMotor
Definition
The `resetMotor` function allows you to reset the motor rotation counter.

ev3.resetTouchCount
Definition
The `resetTouchCount` function allows you to reset the touch counter.

ev3.stopMove
Definition
The `stopMove` function turns both motors off. Use the 'stopMove' function to stop a robot that was started by the 'move' function earlier in the program. If withBrake is "True", the motors are stopped immediately. The motors will be held in their stopped position until another function starts them, or until the program ends. If withBrake is "False", power to the motors is simply turned off. The motors will coast using any remaining momentum until they stop, or until another function starts.
